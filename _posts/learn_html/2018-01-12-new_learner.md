## This post is specially designed for my sweetheart:)


 I will try to explain it as easy as possible:)

 For every html page, you can treat it as a kind of documents. Hence, we have to start every page with <!DOCTYPE html> to define the type of document.

 In HTML5 coding, the commands always start with <something> and end with <\something>.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
